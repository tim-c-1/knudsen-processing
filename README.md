# KEA single beam bathymetry data prep

This repository is a collection of scripts used to take raw .kea files from a knudesen echosounder, extract necessary information to excel format for manual editing, and then combine the final data into an xyz file in csv format.  
Paths and other specific names need to be edited before use.
